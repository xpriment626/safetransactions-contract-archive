# SafeTX Contract

Wrote this contract after having a flashback to that time I accidentally burned a few hundred dollars on a mistyped wallet address.

The SafeTX smart contract is my attempt at programming as many restrictions as possible into the withdrawal function to ensure the receieving address matches an address registered by the wallet owner.

## Smart Contract Archive

Repositories with the -archive notation are practice projects to demonstrate my ability to write functional Solidity code with real world use cases. I also use these as educational material for some of the peer-to-peer mentorship I do on the side.
